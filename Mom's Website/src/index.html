      <p class="about_text animated">
Jillian Theorgood is a Philadelphia native who prides herself as being hard-working,
positive and community focused. She always sees the cup as half-full regardless of
the circumstance. Always seeing the positive in everything and everyone. Jillian is
the type of person that when you meet her you meet a new friend. If she had $20
and you needed half, she wouldn’t think twice about giving it to you.
In addition to her professional career in Human Resources, Jillian stayed involved in
her community as a Darby Borough Councilwoman and Tax Collector. As a
Councilwoman she developed a Darby Borough Youth Police Academy designed to
open the lines of communication between police officers and youth. She even
volunteered as a head track coach for a local catholic middle school for nine seasons.
When faced with the challenge of raising a child with a heart condition, Tetralogy of
Fallot ( TOF), she rose to the challenge by becoming fully educated on his condition.
She is now sharing her successes with other families.
As a young mother, Jillian put herself through school and earned a bachelor’s
degree from Temple University and a master’s degree from Saint Joseph’s
University. She raised three successful young men as a single parent; Brandon,
Delmar Jr. (DJ), and Julian. She is also a very proud grandmother of a 9-year-old
grandson, Demetri. Jillian considers her family to be her most valuable resource
and is proud to admit that her grandmother, Deborah Mosley, mother, Karen Davis
and sister, Pamela Theorgood have been hands on and instrumental in helping her
stay strong and resilient. Jillian recently found her soulmate, Eddie “Cowboy”
Abraham, who enjoys helping others as much as she does. The adventures with

        Inspiration Behind the Book
      </h3>
      <p class = "inspo_text">
        Imagine receiving news that your child has a congenital chronic illness that no one
in your immediate circle has ever experienced. To whom do you can seek advice or
comfort? How do you cope? This is the story of my journey to becoming a
champion and advocate for my son. I also share the lessons I have learned along
the way, as well as a D.E.L.M.A.R. log to get your started with resources to record
your child's vital medical information to help you navigate the plethora of medical
appointments.
My son was born with a congenital heart disease and had many hospitalizations,
five surgeries and countless procedures. I started my journey completely
overwhelmed and terrified that I would lose my child. But I learned early on that
by researching his condition, treatments, and medications, I felt more confident
caring for him and was also able to properly advocate for him. My participation in
his care allowed my son to trust me and trust the process, which positively affected
healing process.
Despite all that he had to endure with his congential illness, he grew up to be the
most positive, ambitious young man. He participated in sports and even ran track
while in mild heart failure. If you meet my son, Delmar Jr. (DJ) today, you will
never guess that he had been through all that he had to endure. He thrived
because I became more than a parent, I became his advocator and shield.
Millions of children are born or diagnosed each year with congenital or chronic
illness. Often, it's difficult to find relatable reading material. This book gives
insight not only to time spent with hospitalizations and doctor visits, but also the
time in between. This book will also provide Caregivers and their caregivers with

resources to effectively support their loved ones. I want to help them get prepared
for one of the most challenging yet rewarding journeys they will ever have.

        Key Messages
      </h3>
      <p class = "key_text">
    In the blink of an eye, your life can change dramatically when your child is born
with or diagnosed with a chronic illness. It is easy to become overwhelmed and
feel hopeless and powerless. But as the parent or caregiver, you have all the
power in the world to make a difference in the life of your child. You have the
power to choose the doctor that works best for your child, as well as what course
of treatment and medication work best for your child. You are paying the doctors
you choose, not the other way around. The best advocate for your child is
someone who is with them daily and can communicate how they are progressing
between medical appointments. Once you realize this and gain knowledge about
the diagnosis, you learn how important your role is and then you begin to feel
confident and empowered. You can overcome anything as long as you take it step
by step. Progression is key. With every step forward, brings new hope. Look for
that bright light in the darkness.
Remember,
1. You are strong enough to handle this journey and your attitude
will make all the difference in the world for your child
2. By gaining knowledge about an illness, you become equipped to
actively participate in all aspects of your child’s care
3. Allow your “village” to participate and take pressure off you and
your child whenever possible

          About the DELMAR log
        </h3>
        <p class = "closing_text1">
          The DELMAR Log is the Daily Efficient Log for Medical Appointment Recording.
The log is designed to help individuals manage the vital medical health information
for themselves and/or their dependents. The log stores information such as
diagnosis for chronic and/or congenital illnesses, family medication history, allergies
of any type, immunizations and vaccinations, past and current prescription
information, primary care provider and Specialist information, dental information,
vision, test results, surgical appointment reminders, customizable logs to record
blood pressure readings and much more. Sharing accurate information with
doctors on a timely basis, especially if you have a chronic illness and/or treat with
more than one doctor, helps them tailor your treatment plan specifically to you and
not treat you based on a plan from other people previously treated and/or textbook
cases.
There is no doubt in my mind that families will use the DELMAR log in slightly
different ways that will most aid them. I encourage that. The hope is that you take
the first step to organize your medical information.
The mobile version of the D.E.L.M.A.R. log will be available soon.
